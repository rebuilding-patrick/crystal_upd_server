# crystal_upd_server
upd server for Crystal lang. Still a work in progress but it's fairly functional right now minus the reliabliy/rebroadcast stratagies. Core functionality come from Network. Connection is for keeping track of the connection, doesn't really do much except log packets right now. Server and Client are untested but should work.
